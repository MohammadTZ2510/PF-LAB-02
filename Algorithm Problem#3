1. Start
2. Input two numbers: A and B
3. Input an operator (either +, -, *, /, %)
4. Based on the operator:
    If operator is +, calculate and print A+B
    If operator is -, calculate and print A−B
    If operator is *, calculate and print A∗B
    If operator is /, check if B≠0:
        If true, calculate and print A/B
        Else, print "Division by zero is not allowed"
    If operator is %, check if B≠0:
        If true, calculate and print A%B
        Else, print "Remainder by zero is not allowed"

5. End
